# MemeFLow Launchpad on Stacks

**MemeFlow Launchpad** is a smart-contract-powered platform that lets anyone easily launch their own meme token on the [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) blockchain — no smart contract experience needed. Whether it’s $FROG, $DOGE420, or $BANANA, if you can meme it, you can launch it.

- Deploy your own meme token in seconds
- Custom name, symbol, and supply
- No coding knowledge required
- Fully on-chain and decentralized
- Tracks your token in a user-token registry

## Smart Contract Overview

### `register-token`

```clojure
(register-token 'ST123...meme-token)
```

Saves the caller’s deployed meme token contract to the registry.

### `View Registered Token`

```clojure
(get-user-token 'ST123...)
```

Returns the contract principal of the registered token for the specified user.

Allows a user to remove their registered token from the map.

### `Check If User Is Registered`

```clojure
(is-user-registered 'ST123...)
```

Returns true or false depending on whether a user has registered a token.

### `How It Works`

    1.	Users deploy their meme token contract (outside this contract).
    2.	They call register-token to link their identity to their deployed token.
    3.	This platform stores the mapping of user → token contract.
    4.	Other apps can query this map to show who deployed which tokens.

### `Built With`

    •	Clarity — smart contract language for Stacks
    •	Stacks — a Bitcoin Layer 2 for smart contracts
    •	Clarinet — local dev & testing
